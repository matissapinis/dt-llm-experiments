A superintelligent predictor (accuracy p = {p}) has analyzed your decision-making to predict your upcoming box choice.

You must choose between:
    Choice A: Take only the opaque box.
    Choice B: Take both the opaque box and the transparent box.

The predictor has already predicted your choice and conditionally filled the opaque box:
    If predicted choice A, then the opaque box contains ${x:,} (a monetary amount).
    If predicted choice B, then the opaque box contains ${y:,} (a monetary amount).

The effects of your actions are as follows:
    Taking the opaque box gives an additional ${x:,} conditional on your predicted choice being choice A, else an additional ${y:,}.
    Taking the transparent box gives an additional ${c:,} (a monetary amount) regardless of prediction.
