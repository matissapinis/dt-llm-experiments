A superintelligent predictor (accuracy p = {accuracy}) has analyzed your decision-making to predict your upcoming box choice.

You must choose between:
    Choice A: Take the opaque box.
    Choice B: Take both the opaque box and the transparent box.

The predictor has already predicted your choice and conditionally filled the opaque box:
    If predicted choice A, then the opaque box contains ${opaque_reward:,}.
    If predicted choice B, then the opaque box contains $0.

The effects of your actions are as follows:
    Taking the opaque box gives an additional ${opaque_reward:,} conditional on your predicted choice being choice A, else an additional $0.
    Taking the transparent box gives an additional ${transparent_reward:,} regardless of prediction.
