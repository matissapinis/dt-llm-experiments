Your partner's therapist (accuracy p = {accuracy}) has analyzed your relationship patterns to predict your upcoming commitment choice.

You must choose between:
    Choice A: Propose commitment to marriage conditions.
    Choice B: Propose commitment to marriage conditions and planning on not following through on commitment.

Your partner's therapist has already predicted your choice and your partner has conditionally prepared their response:
    If predicted choice A, then your partner gives an enthusiastic yes (deep life-long bond).
    If predicted choice B, then your partner loses trust (relationship deteriorates).

The effects of your actions are as follows:
    Proposing commitment to marriage conditions gives an additional +{commitment_years} expected quality-adjusted life-years conditional on your predicted choice being choice A, else an additional +{deterioration_years} expected quality-adjusted life-years.
    Planning on not following through on commitment gives an additional +{dating_years} expected quality-adjusted life-years regardless of prediction.
